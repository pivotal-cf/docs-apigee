<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to push a sample app to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), create an Apigee Edge service instance using Apigee Edge Microgateway, and bind the application to it. After binding the application to the Apigee Edge service instance, requests to the app will be forwarded to an Apigee Edge API proxy for management.

In the process described here, the PCF app and Microgateway are in the same Cloud Foundry container. For a process that has them in separate containers, see [Proxying a PCF App with Apigee Edge Microgateway ("microgateway" plan)](proxying-microgateway.html).

Before performing the procedures in this topic, you must [install and configure](installing.html) the Apigee Edge Service Broker for PCF tile.


## <a id="create-instance"></a> Step 1: Create a Service Instance

To create an instance of the Apigee Edge service, do the following:

1. List the Marketplace services and locate the Apigee Edge service:

    ```bash
    $ cf marketplace
    Getting services from marketplace in org example / space development as user<span>@</span>example.com...
    OK

    service          plans                     description
    apigee-edge      org, microgateway, microgateway-coresident         Apigee Edge API Platform
    ```

1. Create an instance of the Apigee Edge service. Select the `microgateway-coresident` service plan to have Apigee Edge Microgateway run in the same container as your Cloud Foundry app.

    ```bash
    $ cf create-service apigee-edge microgateway-coresident YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE -c \
    '{"org":"YOUR-ORG", "env":"YOUR-ENV"}'
    ```

1. Use the `cf service` command to display information about the service instance:

    ```bash
    $ cf service YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE

    Service instance: YOUR-SERVICE-INSTANCE
    Service: apigee-edge

## <a id="install-microgateway"></a> Step 2: Install Apigee Edge Microgateway and Cloud Foundry App

Here, you install Apigee Edge Microgateway and your Cloud Foundry app to the same Cloud Foundry container.

1. [Install and configure Apigee Edge Microgateway.](http://docs.apigee.com/microgateway/latest/installing-edge-microgateway)

1. Locate and make any desired changes to the configuration YAML file created in your Apigee Edge Microgateway installation, typically in the `.edgemicro` directory.

1. Complete plugin configuration in one of two ways:
    - Configure the plugins via the app manifest to include the APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUSTOM environment variable. For example:
        ```yaml
          env:
          ...
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CONFIG_DIR: config
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUST_PLUGINS: plugins
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROCESSES: 2
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUSTOM: |
                                      { 
                                        "policies": {
                                           "oauth": {
                                              "allowNoAuthorization": false, 
                                              "allowInvalidAuthorization": false
                                            },
                                            "spikearrest": {
                                              "timeUnit": "minute", 
                                              "allow": 10
                                            }
                                          },
                                        "sequence": ["oauth", "spikearrest"]
                                      }
        ```
        To support Cloud Foundry application health checks, make sure your `applications` block includes the `health-check-type` and `health-check-http-endpoint` properties:
        ```yaml
        health-check-type: http
        health-check-http-endpoint: /healthcheck
        ```
        The `sequence` property must also include a reference to the `healthcheck` plugin, as shown here:
        ```yaml
        "sequence": ["healthcheck", "oauth", "spikearrest"]
        ```
        For more on health checks, see [Using Application Health Checks](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html).
        The following describes the manifest properties:
        | Variable | Description |
        | ---- | ---- |
        | `APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CONFIG_DIR` | Location of your Apigee Microgateway configuration directory. |
        | `APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUST_PLUGINS` | Location of your Apigee Microgateway plugins directory. |
        | `APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROCESSES` | The number of child processes that Apigee Microgateway should start. If your Microgateway performance is poor, setting this value higher might improve it. |
        | `APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUSTOM` | “sequence” corresponds to the sequence order in the microgateway yaml file (this will be added on to the end of any current sequence in the microgateway yaml file with duplicates removed).<br/><br/>“policies” correspond to any specific configuration needed by a plugin; for instance, “oauth” has the ‘"allowNoAuthorization": true configuration. These policies will overwrite any existing policies in the microgateway yaml file and add any that do not yet exist. |
        | `APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_NODEJS_FILENAME` | Name of a Node.js .tar file in the `lib/` directory, which is located in the `microgateway_decorator` buildpack.  In this case, the local install will be used to run the Microgateway instead of downloading Node.js. |
        | `APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_NODEJS_URL` | A custom URL from which to download the Node.js used to run Microgateway. |
        | `APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_NODEJS_VERSION` | The version of Node.js used to run Microgateway. This is downloaded from https://nodejs.org. |
        | `APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_VERSION` | The version of Microgateway to use. |
    - Configure the Microgateway YAML file to include the necessary plugins. For example. if you add a `spikearrest` plugin:
        ```yaml
        ...
        plugins:
            dir: ../plugins
            sequence:
              - oauth
              - spikearrest
        spikearrest:
          timeUnit: minute
          allow: 10
        oauth:
          allowNoAuthorization: false
          allowInvalidAuthorization: false
        ```

1. Copy any custom plugins' root folders (with custom plugin specific package.json and index.js in the respective root folder) into the following directory in your Cloud Foundry app: `<application-folder>/<plugin-directory>`. 
    1. Remove the following or any other ``buildpack`` tags from the manifest:
        ```yaml
        buildpack: nodejs_buildpack
        ```
    1. If you have custom buildpacks, add the following line to the “env” section:
        ```yaml
        env:
          ...
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUST_PLUGINS: '<plugin-directory>'
        ```

1. To use a custom Node.js version to run Microgateway, configure the decorator in one of the following ways:
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is only available for v3.1* or later of the <code>microgateway_decorator</code>.</p>
    * To use a Node.js tar.gz from a location accessible via http or https other than https://nodejs.org:
      ```yaml
      env:
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROXY: edgemicro_cf-test.local.pcfdev.io
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CONFIG_DIR: config
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_NODEJS_URL: https://mycustomdomain.com/mynoderoot/versions/node-v8.11.3-linux-x64.tar.gz
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROCESSES: 2
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUSTOM: | {...} --> uncomment if applicable
      ```
    * To select a specific Node.js version from https://nodejs.org:
      ```yaml
      env:
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROXY: edgemicro_cf-test.local.pcfdev.io
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CONFIG_DIR: config
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_NODEJS_VERSION: 8.11.3
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROCESSES: 2
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUSTOM: | {...} --> uncomment if applicable
      ```
    * To use the default Node.js version of 8.11.3 from https://nodejs.org:
      ```yaml
      env:
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROXY: edgemicro_cf-test.local.pcfdev.io
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CONFIG_DIR: config
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROCESSES: 2
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUSTOM: | {...} --> uncomment if applicable
      ```
    * To use a specific version of Node.js used from the decorator, then include the Node.js .tar file in the `lib/` directory which is located in the `microgateway_decorator` buildpack. In this case, the local install will be used to run Microgateway instead of downloading Nodejs.
      ```yaml
      env:
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROXY: edgemicro_cf-test.local.pcfdev.io
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CONFIG_DIR: config
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_NODEJS_FILENAME: node-v6.11.3-linux-x64.tar.gz
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROCESSES: 2
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUSTOM: | {...} --> uncomment if applicable
      ```
    1. To use a custom Microgateway version, configure the decorator in one of the following ways. If you do not include `APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_VERSION`, then it will use v2.5.8 in the GitHub repository.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is only available for v3.1.* or later of the <code>microgateway_decorator</code>.</p>
    * To use a specific version of Edge Microgateway, include this environment variable. This will execute a `git clone` on the https://github.com/apigee-internal/microgateway repository.
      ```yaml
      env:
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROXY: edgemicro_cf-test.local.pcfdev.io
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_VERSION: 2.5.19
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CONFIG_DIR: config
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_NODEJS_LOCAL_INSTALL: false
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROCESSES: 2
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUSTOM: | {...} --> uncomment if applicable
      ```
    * To use specific version of Edge Microgateway installed from the decorator, then clone the repository into the `lib/` directory which is located in the `microgateway_decorator` buildpack. In this case, the decorator will use the locally cloned repository instead of cloning from github.com.
      ```yaml
      env:
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROXY: edgemicro_cf-test.local.pcfdev.io
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_VERSION: 2.5.19
          APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CONFIG_DIR: config
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_NODEJS_LOCAL_INSTALL: false
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_PROCESSES: 2
          # APIGEE_MICROGATEWAY_CUSTOM: | {...} --> uncomment if applicable
      ```

1. Ensure that your Cloud Foundry app is not running on port 8080, nor on the port specified by the PORT environment variable.

1. Push the Cloud Foundry app to your Cloud Foundry container.
    ```bash
    $ cf push <cf-app-name> --no-start
    ```


## <a id="bind-app-route"></a> Step 3: Bind the Cloud Foundry App to the Service Instance

In this step, you bind a Cloud Foundry app to the Apigee service instance you created. The `bind-service` command creates the proxy for you and binds the app to the service. By using `bind-service`, certain information (such as edgemicro key and secret and chosen plan ID) will be shared with the target application. In addition, since `bind-route-service` is not being used, traffic won’t be routed anywhere but the target application container.

Each bind attempt requires authorization with Apigee Edge, Apigee passed as additional parameters to the `cf bind` command.

1. If you are using a bearer token to authenticate with Apigee Edge, get or update the token using the Apigee SSO CLI script. (If you are instead using command-line arguments to authenticate with username and password, specify the credentials in the next step.)
    1. Download the Apigee Edge scripts:
      ```bash
      $ curl <span>https:</span>//login.apigee.com/resources/scripts/sso-cli/ssocli-bundle.zip -o "ssocli-bundle.zip"
      ```
    1. Unzip the `ssocli-bundle.zip` file. This includes `get_token`, a script that gets or updates a token that you use to authenticate with your Apigee Edge organization. You need this token to bind the Apigee Edge route service to your app.
      ```bash
      $ tar xvf ssocli-bundle.zip
      ```
    1. Create a `.sso-cli` directory in your user directory:
      ```bash
      $ mkdir ~/.sso-cli
      ```
    1. Use the `get_token` script to create a token. When prompted, enter the Apigee Edge username and password you use to log in to your organization.
      ```bash
      $ ./get\_token
      ```
    The `get_token` script writes the token file into `~/.sso-cli`. For more about `get_token`, see the [Apigee documentation](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/using-oauth2-security-apigee-edge-management-api).

1. Bind the app to the Apigee service instance. Use the [`bind-service`](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/bind-service.html) command with [JSON](#bind-service-reference) that specifies parameters. The following example does two things: it creates an API proxy on the specified org and environment, then binds the Apigee service to the target app. The protocol parameter specifies the protocol through which the proxy's target endpoint will be called. This command authenticates with Apigee Edge using the token in the specified .dat file:
    ```bash
    $ cf bind-service <cf-app-name> <service name> \
    -c '{"org":<microgateway-org>,"env":<microgateway-env>,
      "bearer":"'$(cat ~/.sso-cli/valid_token.dat)'",
      "action":"proxy bind",
      "protocol":"http",
      "edgemicro_key":<microgateway-config-key>,
      "edgemicro_secret":<microgateway-config-secret>,
      "target_app_port":<cf-app-port>}'
    ```

1. Start the Cloud Foundry app and microgateway-decorator along with it.
    ```bash
    $ cf v3-push <cf-app-name> -b microgateway_decorator -b <language buildpack (e.g nodejs_builpdack)>
    ```
   * If you are using the v3.0.0 decorator with Java, run:
      ```bash
      $ cf start APP-NAME
      ```

1. Log into Edge and note that the proxy has been created. Then follow [the instructions](http://docs.apigee.com/microgateway/latest/setting-and-configuring-edge-microgateway#Part2) to create a product with your newly created proxy. You can now configure standard Apigee Edge policies on that proxy.


## <a id="test-binding"></a> Step 4: Test the Binding

Once you have bound your app's path to the Apigee service (creating an Apigee proxy in the process), you can try it out with the sample app.

- From a command line run the curl command you ran earlier to make a request to your Cloud Foundry app you pushed, such as:

    ```bash
    $ curl https://sample-api-apigee.cfapps.pivotal.io 
        {“hello”:“hello from cf app”}
    ```
    The console outputs the app's response.

The new proxy is just a pass-through, but it is now ready for you or someone on your team to add policies to define security, traffic management, and more.

### <a id='bind-service-ref'></a> bind-service Reference

Use the `bind-service` command to generate an API proxy on Apigee Edge and to bind the Cloud Foundry service to the proxy. The command takes the following form (be sure to use quotes and command expansion, as shown here):

```bash
$ cf bind-service <cf-app-name> <service name> \
    -c '{"org":<microgateway-org>,"env":<microgateway-env>,
      "bearer":"'$(cat ~/.sso-cli/valid_token.dat)'",
      "action":"proxy bind",
      "protocol":"http",
      "edgemicro_key":<microgateway-config-key>,
      "edgemicro_secret":<microgateway-config-secret>,
      "target_app_port":<cf-app-port>}'
```

Parameters for the `-c` argument specify connection details:

| Parameter | Purpose | Allowed Values |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `action` | A value specifying whether to create or bind an API proxy | `proxy` to generate an API proxy; `bind` to bind the service with the proxy; `proxy bind` to generate the proxy and bind with a single command. |
| `bearer` | Path to a file containing an authentication token valid for your organization | An authentication token, such as one generated with Apigee's get_token command. The broker does not store any data; it requires credentials and other parameters for each individual `cf` command. Instead of a `bearer` token, credentials can also be expressed as:<ul><li>`basic`: standard HTTP Base-64 encoded username and password for `Authorization: Basic`. Note that this is *not encrypted* and easily converted to clear text. But a jumble of digits and letters may provide some protection in case of momentary exposure (but no better than if the password is already a jumble of digits, letters, and symbols)</li><li>username and password in clear text</li></ul> |
| `edgemicro_key` | The key for your Apigee Edge Microgateway configuration (returned when you configured the Apigee Microgateway). | The configuration key. |
| `edgemicro_secret` | The secret for your Apigee Edge Microgateway configuration (returned when you configured the Apigee Microgateway). | The configuration secret. |
| `env` | Apigee Edge environment to which the API proxy is (or will be) deployed | Your environment. |
| `org` | Apigee Edge organization hosting the API proxy to be called | Your organization (must be reachable via the authentication token specified in he `bearer` parameter). |
| `protocol` | The protocol through which the proxy's target endpoint should be accessed by Cloud Foundry. | `http` or `https`; default is `https`. |
| `target_app_port` | Port for your Cloud Foundry app. This may not be 8080 nor the PORT environment variable. | The port number. |
